**In Interviews:**
```
"I built TaskFlow, a full-stack application with complete CI/CD 
automation. The most challenging part was implementing zero-downtime 
deployments. I solved this by creating health check endpoints and 
adding validation stages in the Jenkins pipeline. This reduced our 
mean time to recovery from 15 minutes to under 5 minutes."
